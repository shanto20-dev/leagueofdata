## Background and Overview

League of Data is a visually compelling data visualizer for League of Legends data about any player of your choosing. League of Data offers two basic pages of data - stats about the player in general and stats about recent games that were played. 

## Functionality and MVPs

In League of Data, a user will be able to search for a player via their "Summoner Name" (in-game name). The user will then be able to select whether they want to view stats about the player or stats about the player's recent games. The Player Data will be an aesthetic view of the player's key stats, favorite champions, favorite items, etc. The Recent Games page will have visual representations about some stats about the player's recent games - including stats about team's gold, KDA, objectives, etc.
