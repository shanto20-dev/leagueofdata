## Background and Overview

League of Data is a visually compelling data visualizer for League of Legends data for professional League of Legends players of your choosing.

## Functionality and MVPs

In League of Data, a user will be able to search for a professional player via their "Summoner Name" (in-game name). A page will render that will be an aesthetic view of the player's key stats, favorite champions, gold earned, etc.

In addition, League of Data will include buttons to view top player's stats on the homepage (in case the user doesn't know any professional players to look up). 


## Architecture and Technology

League of Data will be built using Javascript, HTML & CSS, and D3 for data visualization.
